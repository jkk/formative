![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/jkk/formative/tree/master.png?circle-token=89665c8e9ec20d87fcb09a3cf731039dcdf398e8)

Web forms for __Clojure__ and __ClojureScript__:

* Render a form via pluggable renderers (comes with Bootstrap and other renderers built in)
* Parse form data from Ring-style param maps or strings
* Validate parsed data using [Verily](https://github.com/jkk/verily)

See a __live demo__ at [formative-demo.herokuapp.com](http://formative-demo.herokuapp.com/) ([demo source](https://github.com/jkk/formative-demo))

## Installation

Leiningen coordinate:

```clj
[formative "0.8.9"]
```

## Usage

The important namespaces are `formative.core` and `formative.parse`.

```clj
(ns example.core
  (:require [formative.core :as f]
            [formative.parse :as fp]))
```

For the ClojureScript version, there's also `formative.dom` (see [Dom Helpers](#dom-helpers)).

### Building a Form

To build a form, you need a form specification, which is a map that looks like this:

```clj
(def example-form
  {:fields [{:name :secret-code :type :hidden :datatype :int}
            {:name :email :type :email}
            {:name :password :type :password}
            {:name :remember :type :checkbox}]
   :validations [[:required [:secret-code :email :password]]
                 [:min-length 8 :password]]
   :values {:secret-code 1234
            :remember true}})
```

The map can contain keys such as `:method` and `:action` that directly correspond to HTML form attributes (although unlike HTML, "post" is the default `:method`). It can also contain special keys such as `:fields` and `:submit-label`. See the [Form Specification](#form-specification) section for more about the specification format.

### Rendering a Form

Render a form using `formative.core/render-form`:

```clj
(f/render-form example-form)
;; Returns:
[:div {:class "form-shell form-horizontal bootstrap-form"}
 [:form {:method :post}
  ;; ... etc ...
  ]]
```

Using the default `:bootstrap-horizontal` renderer and a [Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/) theme, the form will look something like this when passed through [Hiccup](https://github.com/weavejester/hiccup) or [Dommy](https://github.com/Prismatic/dommy):

![form](https://github.com/jkk/formative/raw/master/doc/bootstrap-horizontal.png)

Note: Formative does not include any CSS or images. You are responsible for providing those yourself.

Renderers are pluggable and can return any kind of format -- e.g., Hiccup or string. Formative comes with several built-in Hiccup renderers which you can set using the `:renderer` form specification key:

* `:bootstrap-horizontal` (the default)
* `:bootstrap-stacked`
* `:bootstrap3-stacked`
* `:table`
* `:inline`

Custom form renderers can be implemented using the `formative.render/render-form` multimethod.

You can also render individual fields using `formative.core/render-field`. Unlike `render-form`, `render-field` _always_ returns Hiccup data. `render-field` takes a field specification and an optional value:

```clj
(f/render-field {:name :flavor
                 :type :select
                 :options ["Chocolate" "Vanilla" "Strawberry"]}
                "Vanilla")
;; Returns:
[:select {:name "flavor"}
 ([:option {:value "Chocolate"} "Chocolate"]
  [:option {:value "Vanilla", :selected true} "Vanilla"]
  [:option {:value "Strawberry"} "Strawberry"])]
```

Notice that the "Vanilla" option is selected in our generated element.

All of the built-in form renderers make use of `render-field`, but not all renderers are required to do so.

### Parsing Form Data

`formative.parse/parse-params` will turn a form specification and form data into a map of parsed form data. It will parse each field according to its `:type` or `:datatype` keys.

```clj
;; From Ring param map
(fp/parse-params example-form
                 {:secret-code "1234"
                  :email "foobar@gmail.com"
                  :password "barbazquux"
                  :remember "false"})
;; Returns:
{:remember false, :secret-code 1234, :password "barbazquux", :email "foobar@gmail.com"}

;; From form data string
(fp/parse-params example-form
                 "secret-code=1234&email=foobar@gmail.com&password=bzrbazquux&remember=false")
;; Returns:
{:remember false, :secret-code 1234, :password "barbazquux", :email "foobar@gmail.com"}
```

Notice that the `:remember` and `:secret-code` fields have been parsed from strings into their respective datatypes.

By default, validation will be performed on the parsed values and an exception thrown if validation fails. If the `:validate` keyword option to `parse-params` is `false`, `ParseError` records will be used in place of values that failed to parse, and no validation will be done.

Any exception thrown due to a failed parse or validation will contain a `:problems` `ex-data` key with information about the failed exception.

```clj
(fp/parse-params example-form {:secret-code "xxx"})
;; ExceptionInfo Problem parsing params  clojure.core/ex-info (core.clj:4227)

(ex-data *e)
;; {:problems ({:keys (:secret-code), :msg "must be a number"}), â€¦}

(fp/parse-params example-form {:secret-code "xxx"} :validate false)
{:secret-code #formative.parse.ParseError{:bad-value "xxx"}}
```

The `formative.parse/with-fallback` macro (or `formative.macros/with-fallback` for ClojureScript) is a handy way to try parsing params, and call a "fallback" function if it fails. The fallback function will be supplied the problems as its argument.

```clj
(defn submit-example-form [params]
  ;; Calls (show-example-form params :problems problems) if parsing fails
  (fp/with-fallback #(show-example-form params :problems %)
    (let [values (fp/parse-params example-form params))]
      ;; Success
      (prn-str values)))
```

### Validating Parsed Data

Formative uses [Verily](https://github.com/jkk/verily) to validate parsed data. By default, only datatypes are validated (unless `:validate-types` is set to `false`).

There are two ways to add your own validation to a form: `:validations` and `:validator`.

#### `:validations`

A sequence of validation specifications. For example:

```clj
[[:required [:foo :bar :password]]
 [:equal [:password :confirm-password] "Passwords don't match, dummy"]
 [:min-length 8 :password]]
```

All validation specifications accept a key or sequence of keys. The message is always optional.

Unless `:required` is used, all validations allow the keys to be absent from the map, or have a `nil` value (or blank if a string-based type).

Built in validations:

* `:required <keys> [msg]` - must not absent, blank, or nil
* `:contains <keys> [msg]` - must not be absent, but can be blank or nil
* `:not-blank <keys> [msg]` - may be absent but not blank or nil
* `:exact <value> <keys> [msg]` - must be a particular value
* `:equal <keys> [msg]` - all keys must be equal
* `:email <keys> [msg]` - must be a valid email
* `:url <keys> [msg]` - must be a valid URL
* `:web-url <keys> [msg]` - must be a valid website URL (http or https)
* `:us-tel <keys> [msg]` - must be a valid US phone number
* `:matches <regex> <keys> [msg]` - must match a regular expression
* `:min-length <len> <keys> [msg]` - must be a certain length (for strings or collections)
* `:max-length <len> <keys> [msg]` - must not exceed a certain length (for strings or collections)
* `:complete <keys> [msg]` - must be a collection with no blank or nil values
* `:min-val <min> <keys> [msg]` - must be at least a certain value
* `:max-val <max> <keys> [msg]` - must be at most a certain value
* `:within <min> <max> <keys> [msg]` - must be within a certain range (inclusive)
* `:after <date> <keys> [msg]` - must be after a certain date
* `:before <date> <keys> [msg]` - must be before a certain date
* `:in <coll> <keys> [msg]` - must be contained within a collection
* `:us-zip <keys> [msg]` - must be a valid US zip code
* `:us-state <keys> [msg]` - must be a valid two-letter US state code
* `:ca-state <keys> [msg]` - must be a valid two-letter Canadian province code
* `:country <keys> [msg]` - must be a valid ISO alpha2 country code
* Datatype validations: `:string`, `:boolean`, `:integer`, `:float`, `:decimal`, `:date`
* Datatype collection validations: `:strings`, `:booleans`, `:integers`, `:floats`, `:decimals`, `:dates`

#### `:validator`

A function that takes a map of parsed values and returns a problem map or sequence of problem maps. A problem map has the keys `:keys`, indicating which keys were problems (optional), and `:msg`, a description of what's wrong. If `nil` or an empty sequence is returned, validation succeeds.

```clj
(defn validate-password [values]
  (when (#{"12345" "password" "hunter2"} (:password values))
    {:keys [:password] :msg "You can't use that password"}))
```

See [Verily](https://github.com/jkk/verily) for more about validation functions.

## Making Changes at Runtime

Typically form specifications are defined as vars, so you can refer to them easily from functions. However, many forms incorporate or depend on runtime data. For example, you might add or remove fields depending on the access level of the user.

You are of course free to tweak the form map yourself to make the appropriate runtime changes before rendering it. But `merge-fields` and `remove-fields` may come in handy and save you time.

`merge-fields` can modify and insert/append fields. `remove-fields` removes fields. Both can operate on a form or a sequence of fields. Example:

```clj
(let [form {:fields [{:name :a} {:name :b} {:name :c}]}]
  (-> form
      (f/merge-fields [{:name :a :datatype :int}
                       {:name :d :before :c}])
      (f/remove-fields [:b])))
;; {:fields ({:datatype :int, :name :a} {:name :d} {:name :c})}
```

As shown above, `merge-fields` will look for `:before` and `:after` keys in the given fields to decide whether to insert the field or append it.

## DOM Helpers

For the ClojureScript version of Formative, several DOM helpers are provided in the `formative.dom` namespace. For the most common use case, there's `formative.dom/handle-submit`, which attaches an event handler to a form's "submit" browser event, validates submitted data, then:

* If validation fails, shows the problems (or, if provided, calls a custom failure function with the problems data as the argument)
* If validation succeeds, calls a success function with parsed params as the argument

Example:

```clj
(formative.dom/handle-submit
  example-form container-el
  (fn [params]
    (js/alert (pr-str params))))
```

Other useful functions in `formative.dom`:

* `serialize [form-el]` - given a form element, returns a form data string
* `clear-problems [container-or-form-el]` - clears problems from a form
* `show-problems [form-spec container-or-form-el problems]` - shows problems for a form

## CSRF Protection

If you include the [ring-anti-forgery](https://github.com/weavejester/ring-anti-forgery) middleware in your app, Formative will automatically include its CSRF token in forms with method :post (the default).

## Quick Reference

### Form Specification

Valid keys for a form specification include the following HTML form attributes:

      :action :method :enctype :accept :name :id :class
      :onsubmit :onreset :accept-charset :autofill :novalidate
      :autocomplete

Unlike an HTML form, :method defaults to :post. If method is something other than :get or :post, a hidden field with name "_method" will be added, and the form method set to :post. If you are using Compojure for routing, it will recognize the "_method" field.

The following special keys are also supported:

      :renderer       - Determines the type of renderer to use. Built-in options:
                          :bootstrap-horizontal (the default)
                          :bootstrap-stacked
                          :table
                          :inline
      :fields         - Sequence of form field specifications. See below.
      :values         - Map of values used to populate the form fields, or a
                        form-data-encoded string
      :submit-label   - Label to use on the submit button. Defaults to "Submit"
      :cancel-label   - Label to use on the cancel button. Defaults to "Cancel"
      :cancel-href    - When provided, shows a "Cancel" link or button next to the
                        submit button
      :validations    - A sequence of validation specifications
      :validator      - A function to call to validate parsed values for this
                        form. The function should take a map of values and return
                        a sequence of problem maps for each field that failed to
                        validate. The problem map should contain the keys :keys
                        and :msg.
      :validate-types - Whether to validate datatypes; true by default.
      :problems       - Sequence of field names or problem maps. Form
                        renderers typically add a class and style to highlight
                        problem fields and, if problem maps are provided,
                        show descriptive messages.
      :timezone       - String of timezone with which to localize the display of
                        :datetime-select fields. The default is UTC. JVM only.

New form renderers can be implemented using the `formative.render/render-form` multimethod.

### Field Specification

A field specification is a map with keys corresponding to HTML attributes and
the following special keys:

      :name         - Required name of the field, a keyword or string. Use
                      dotted keywords like :foo.bar to represent fields that
                      will parse as nested map values.
      :label        - Optional display name. Auto-generated from :name if not
                      provided
      :type         - Type of the field. Defaults to :text. See below for
                      built-in types. If an unrecognized type is provided,
                      an <input> element with that type will be assumed.
                      Certain types imply particular parsing or validation
                      rules - e.g., an :email field must be a valid email.
      :datatype     - Optional. Datatype of the field used for parsing. Can be
                      one of:

                      :str, :int, :long, :boolean, :float, :double, :decimal,
                      :bigint, :date, :time, :instant, :file.

                      Defaults to :str.

                      All types can be appended with an "s" when a sequence
                      is expected - e.g., :ints for a sequence of integers. This
                      is useful for fields that have composite values, such as
                      :checkboxes.

                      :date field values are expected to be in yyyy-MM-dd
                      format by default. Set :date-format to change that. :time
                      fields may be in H:m or H:m:s format. :instant fields
                      are in EDN instant (RFC-3339) format.

                      All date/time fields are parsed into java.util.Date
                      or java.sql.Time (or Date for ClojureScript) objects
                      created using the UTC timezone.
      :datatype-error - Optional custom error message to use if datatype
                      validation fails.
      :blank-nil    - When the value is parsed, replace a blank string with nil
      :flatten      - If a value parses to a map (e.g. for :compound fields),
                      adds each key of the map to the top level values map,
                      prefixed with the field name and a dash.
      :note         - A bit of explanatory content to accompany the field
      :prefix       - Content to insert before a field
      :suffix       - Content to insert after a field

### Field Types

Built-in field types:

	  :text         - Single-line text input
	  :textarea     - Multi-line text input
	  :select       - Dropdown. Special keys:

                        :first-option - option to prepend to the other options
      :checkbox     - Defaults to true/false when no :value is given. Special
                      keys:
                        :value - value of a checked input (default true)
                        :unchecked-value - value of an unchecked input (default
                          false)

      :datetime-select - Combined date/time dropdown. Parses as a UTC
                      java.util.Date (or Date for ClojureScript).
                      Accepts Joda date values. See :date-select
                      and :time-select for special keys, plus:
                        :timezone - String of timezone with which to localize the
                                    display. The default is UTC. JVM only.
      :currency     - Text input for money. Parses as a :decimal datatype
      :file         - File upload input. Special keys:
                        :upload-handler - optional handler called when a file is
                          uploaded. The field's specification and Ring param
                          value are passed as arguments to the handler. The
                          handler can return whatever value is appropriate
                          (e.g., a String or a File).
      :compound     - Multiple fields displayed and parsed as one field. Special
                      keys:
                        :separator - string or Hiccup data; defaults to a space
                        :combiner - a function which takes a collection of the
                                    rendered fields and returns Hiccup data
                                    that represents the combined field; by
                                    default, fields are combined by interposing
                                    the separator
      :submit       - Submit button. Included by default, but can be added
                      explicitly if you prefer. Unlike with a default submit
                      button, its value will be parsed.

#### :options

The :options key for :select and other types accepts a collection of any of the following formats:

```clj
      ["value" "label" sub-options]
      {:value "value" :label "label" :options sub-options}
      "value and label"
```

If sub-options are provided, the element is rendered as a group (e.g.,
optgroup for :select fields).

The :options value can also be a function of no arguments or a Delay object -- either of which must yield a collection in one of the above formats.

By default, a field with :options set only accepts values from within :options when validated. Set `:validate-options` to false on the field to accept any value.

#### Presentational Field Types

The following presentational types are also available. They are excluded from parsing.

      :heading      - Section heading. In the default renderer, acts as a fieldset
                      separator. Special keys:
                        :text - heading text
      :html         - Custom, unlabeled HTML. Special keys:
                        :html - HTML string or Hiccup data
      :labeled-html - Custom, labeled HTML. Special keys:
                        :html - HTML string or Hiccup data

Field types are extensible with the `formative.render/render-field` and `formative.parse/parse-input` multimethods.
